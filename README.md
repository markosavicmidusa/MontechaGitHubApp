# MontechaGitHubApp





You have a task to create a React frontend application using Create React app boilerplate. You can use any module to help you (Redux, Mobx, Styled components, Bootstrap, Material UI, etc.), and there is no specific design for the app.

You should create an app that will allow users to browse GitHub user profiles, repositories, and statistics. For this task, you can use one of the public GitHub APIs:

GitHub REST API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest GitHub GraphQL API: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql You will need to create a token to access GitHub API.

The app should have two main pages:

Home page - it should show the information about your GitHub profile (picture, stars, list of repositories, activity, list of gists, bio, etc.) Search page - it should allow the user to search for users their GitHub username. User page - it should show more information about the user we searched for on the search page. Show information such as pictures, stars, list of repositories, activity, list of gists, bio, etc. When you complete the app, push the code in a GitHub repo, and don't forget to put instructions on how to run it in the Readme.

This task should show how you use JavaScript, React, Node.js, and any other libraries that you pick. Pay attention to the file organization, HTML, CSS, data fetching, components.
